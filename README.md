# Twiz
LaHacks Project 2019

Contributors: 
Erwin Acuario: Backend Developer 
Veltson Bastien: Front End Developer 

Project Idea: 
A web app that will allow for members of the community to come together and help each other by presenting awareness to the problems that are not being solved by the government. With Twiz, users can take matters a couple steps further, by bringing it up to the other members of their community. 

Thank you for viewing our project!
